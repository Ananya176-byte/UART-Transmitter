# UART-Transmitter
PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) Transmitter module is a hardware design that enables serial data transmission between digital devices without the need for a shared clock signal. This project focuses on implementing the transmitting end of a UART system using Verilog HDL, targeting FPGA or ASIC environments. The transmitter converts parallel input data (typically 8-bit) into a serial bitstream with start, stop, and optional parity bits, conforming to standard UART protocol.
